  <short_description>2025 Port. Temporarily change the displayed video mode</short_description>
  <long_description>This allows quick changes to the currently displayed video mode. It's also temporary so after a reboot or something like that the settings will be reset to the ones you set in the system settings.

You can change between NTSC and PAL, all the different ports, and change the resolution to whatever you want. I did not include any safe guards for invalid settings so keep that in mind (for example you will not get composite to go to 720p etc.).
